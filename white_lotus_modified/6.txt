Hi.

You were on fire last night. (LAUGHS)

You tried to get me to throw your dead mother’s ashes in the trash.

Oh, my God.

No.

Oh, my God.

So sweet here.

What?

Mr. and Mrs., how are you? Are you all right?

Our deepest apologies again.

And I do hope you find a way to enjoy the rest of your trip.

Uh, I heard you’re taking out the dive boat again today.

That should be diverting. (CHUCKLES)

Morning, ladies.

Did you find our medications?

Afraid not.

Enjoy.

Thank you.

Thanks.

Thank you.

Hey, can I get a coffee, black?

Of course.

Black coffee? Great.

Hey, nice shiner.

Ah.

How’d that happen?

(LAUGHS) You should see the other guy.

Yeah.

(LAUGHS)

No, seriously.

MARK: Yeah, we were going scuba diving, my son and I.

We got our PADI licenses in the pool.

And the girls and I were gonna go, too, you know, just have a nice day on the boat.

And I decided last minute not to go.

So, I was up in the room straightening up.

And then out of nowhere, this guy jumps out.

He was in the room trying to steal my stuff, trying to steal our jewels. They were in the safe.

So, he had gotten into the safe somehow.

He threw me to the ground so violently.

MARK: That’s when I walked in. He doesn’t see me, right?

NICOLE: He has on his scuba suit.

Yeah, I’m fine.

Anything I can do?

No, thank you, though.

Actually, do you know if there’s any rooms available tonight?

I just work at the spa, but I’m happy to call.

No, no, no, no, that’s fine. Don’t.

I just was curious, you know, just in case.

It’s not a big deal.

I was on the canoe.

We went all around the island. It was cool.

NICOLE: Well, you missed breakfast.

And in an hour, we’re going scuba.

I’m pretty beat. Uh, my arms are like numb.

Well, we still gotta scuba. It’s the last day we can do it.

Why?

‘Cause we go home tomorrow.

Oh.

I’m thinking I’m not going home.

Yeah, I think I wanna stay here.

The guys need a sixth for their crossing ’cause the guy that they’ve been training with,

he keeps flaking ’cause he’s a drunk.

And in the spring, we’re all gonna do a Hokule’a through all of Polynesia, which sounds amazing.

Honey, you’re not going on that. You’re 16. You’re in school.

School’s easy. I can just finish online.

(LAUGHS) This is absurd.

What about your life at home?

What life at home?

NICOLE: What about us, your family?

Come visit.

Wait. I can’t tell if you’re being serious.

I’m very serious.

NICOLE: Quinn, is this about your phone?

Because we wouldn’t have your new phone shipped here?

No.

Because relax, it’s gonna be there when we get home.

What? Mom, I don’t care about a phone.

I don’t even want a phone.

Well, you’re getting a phone.

You’re not gonna not have a phone.

MARK: This is ridiculous.

Look, staying here without us, not an option, no.

OLIVIA: I support you, Quinn.

Shane?

LORENZO: I’m going to call Randy Zeoli right now.

Well, good. Go scalp some heads.

LORENZO: You know I will.

All right, Lorenzo.

LORENZO: I’ll call you back.

Thanks.

It’s my mom’s travel agent. The dude is hardcore.

He knows one of the owners of the hotel.

He’s gonna call. He’s gonna raise hell.

Why?

Why? Listen to this.

Okay, you know the family that arrived on the boat with us, the ones you think are weird?

They went back to their room yesterday, and there’s like a jewel thief in their fucking bedroom.

What?

Yeah.

There’s like a fight and everything, and then the guy takes all their stuff.

Oh, my God.

Yeah, he had a key to the room.

The only reason I know about this is ’cause the dad had a shiner and I asked him about it.

The hotel didn’t tell us shit.

Like, if he’s got a key to their room,

he could have a key to our room. Like, who fucking knows?

It’s freaky.

SHANE: I’m serious.

We are in the biggest suite at the hotel.

We could be a target.

(GROANS) I just wish I had a gun or like a baseball bat at least, or something.

You know, like, fucking…

Hmm. Yes!

Hold on.

That’s the knife they gave us to cut the pineapples.

What, are you gonna cut a bunch of pineapples?

Gonna keep this by the bed. Gotta protect my hot wife.

This Armond guy is unbelievable. He’s going down.

Shane.

Lorenzo’s all over it. Oh, how was your facial?

Your face looks nice and shiny.

Shane.

What?

What?

I… I can’t believe that I’m saying this, but, uh… I think I made a mistake.

What’s the mistake?

The mistake is… the mistake is… getting married… to you.

(LAUGHS)

What?

Shane, when I met you, I was… in a weird place. And, uh… I had my bad breakup, and work was so frustrating. And… And then you came along, and you’re so handsome, and I was so attracted to you, and you had so much going on, and… going around the city with you was like a fantasy. All the doors opened, and then you asked me to marry you, and… And look, I admit, when I was little, I had princess dolls, and… I was a girly girl and I dreamt about my wedding day and– and Prince Charming and all that shit.

What the fuck are you talking about?

RACHEL: And then I–

Are you for real right now?

RACHEL: And then I got caught up in the wedding, and that was the last five months, basically. And everyone, you know, I could tell thought I was so lucky, and that made me feel good. But like in the dumbest way. Because… Because now I’m here and–

And what?

RACHEL: And… I realize… I don’t wanna be a plus one my whole life.

Okay, so don’t be.

I mean, I’m not telling you to be anything.

But that’s just how it is.

Okay, so are you blaming me ’cause you’re not more successful?

No, I’m not blaming you for anything. You’ve done nothing wrong.

What a relief. Like… (LAUGHS)

After I’ve wined you and dined you and asked you to marry me, and then made you the center of my life, it’s just nice to know you’re not pissed.

Shane, this is about me. I’m not okay with being a trophy wife, an appendage like all these other women in your world.

Okay, so you’re pretty and that’s part of the appeal for me, and what, that bothers you?

I just need to respect myself.

I gotta hand it to you. Ah– You–

You hid yourself really well, Rachel. I mean, this whole time, I bought that you were this cool chick who was fun and confident and normal. And I had no idea that you were this insecure, naïve baby.

You’re the baby, Shane. Coddled by your mommy, who showed up on your honeymoon. You don’t get the room you want, so you throw a never-ending tantrum. I genuinely cannot believe what a baby-man you can be.

Okay, I’m out. (LAUGHS)

I’m gonna go for a swim.

Because now, we are starting down a very dark road, and you better be sure you really wanna go there.

Oh, I was hoping to catch you. I have good news.

I received a call, and the stolen items, all your jewelry, it’s all been recovered.

Oh, that’s great.

Fantastic.

There’s some sort of process, but I made them promise to give everything back to you before your departure tomorrow.

So, they found the guy?

They did.

Was it an employee?

It was.

Look, on behalf of the hotel, I just wanna say I am so sorry.

What’s his name?

Kai.

And it’s so strange, ’cause he was such a sweet kid.

And I never had a problem with him ever.

I never would’ve guessed him in a million years.

Well, uh, I just wanted to give you the good news about your jewelry.

And I hope you have an incredible dive.

Why are you so down?

Worried you might be going to jail?

I wouldn’t be worried, though.

Unless you sent him some text that could incriminate you.

Did you?

Your island lover who broke into our room.

What?

Paula, cut the crap.

I mean, I didn’t know why you wouldn’t tell me, but I guess it’s ’cause you were planning some sort of heist or something?

Are you serious?

You gave him the code to our safe.

Paula, do you think I’m some sort of idiot?

You’re making a big deal about putting some cheap necklace I have never seen you wear before in the safe.

And then an hour later, the guy you’re screwing breaks into our room and steals all of our shit.

It’s pretty basic.

It’s not what you think.

OLIVIA: Well, what is it?

It’s not like I’m gonna rat you out.

Do you need money or something?

No.

No, it was never for me.

Then what is it?

I just– You won’t understand.

Yes, I will. I’m not my parents, Paula.

PAULA: But you are.

Actually, you are.

And you think you’re like this rebel, but in the end… this is your tribe.

Your family, the people here.

That’s really manipulative, Paula.

You’re the one who stole, yet I’m the bad guy?

Don’t give me that. You’ve stolen, too.

What did I steal?

Well, I guess it’s not stealing when you think everything’s already yours.

Just stop pretending to be my friend.

I’m just some prop you use for some weird cred.

Whatever you did, Paula, it was really fucked up.

My mom could’ve gotten really hurt.

Yeah. Actually, we’re gonna go to Honolulu tomorrow.

Yeah, spend the weekend together.

That is so nice. Make sure to do some shopping.

(LAUGHS)

I know.

And then maybe Aspen, you know, for a couple months, you know, see how that goes.

What? Making big moves?

Good for you, Tanya.

Anyway, we’re gonna be leaving early, and I– I really just wanted to make sure that I didn’t miss you.

Belinda, you’re an amazing person. You are.

I mean, you’ve helped me so much.

I was a mess.

I showed up here, and– and somehow, you were able to just jumpstart my life again.

And I don’t think I’m ever gonna be functional.

(LAUGHS)

But I do think that now, I’ll be able to break some old patterns.

Definitely.

Anyway, about the business… I really need to think about it.

I mean, you’re so talented and I so wanna do this for you, but I’m realizing I’m getting back into this pattern again where I latch on to somebody and then I use my money to control them and see, right now, the last thing I need in my life is another transactional relationship.

You know, it’s just– it’s not healthy for me, you know?

Anyway, I really, I want you to know how grateful I am and I want you to have this.
