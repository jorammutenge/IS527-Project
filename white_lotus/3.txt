He had two lives. He had his family,

and then he had another life with homosexuals.

Yeah, I just got to work myself. (CHUCKLES)

BELINDA’S SON: You’re never not at work.

Oh, you think I’m working hard now,

wait till I start my own business.

BELINDA’S SON: What are you talking about?

I don’t know. I think I’m getting ahead of myself.

There is, um… There’s this woman,

this– this guest,

this rich white lady. (CHUCKLES)

She– she took me out to dinner, and she said

if I wanted to start my own wellness center,

she’d fund the whole thing.

BELINDA’S SON: Mom, you have to do that.

That fucking place exploits you, Mom.

If that lady says jump, you say how high?

(LAUGHS)

Get your own thing going. You deserve it.

Mom, why are you setting up in here and not your own room?

Because I have a Zoom with China,

and I don’t like the background in there.

-When’s the big Zoom?

NICOLE: One.

I don’t like it in here either.

This lighting makes me look freakish.

You sure it’s the lighting?

(DOOR SLAMS)

Quinn. Where have you been?

-I slept on the beach.

NICOLE: Why?

Because of them! Because they made me!

-And now all my shit is gone.

What shit?

My phone, my Nintendo! They got washed away.

My iPad got soaked. It’s fucking ruined.

And now what the fuck am I supposed to do?

(OLIVIA CHUCKLES)

(DOOR SLAMS)

I didn’t tell him to sleep on the beach.

It was his idea, Nicole.

QUINN: They’re lying!

Dad, what’s wrong with you?

Your father got some very upsetting news last night.

-He does have cancer?

NICOLE: No.

He doesn’t have cancer.

He found out something about his father

that he never knew before.

I’m listening.

Your grandfather died of AIDS.

How did he get AIDS?

Apparently, Paula, he was having sex with other men.

-Who was?

NICOLE: Your dad’s dad.

Why?

Because he liked it. Why else?

He was probably closeted.

PAULA: Or bisexual.

Dad, why are you so upset, though?

-You’re like catatonic.

NICOLE: Well, it was a secret

that was kept from him his entire life, Liv.

So now, whatever image he had of his father, of his childhood,

has been pulverized.

You know, he was probably a bottom.

That’s how you mostly get it. Receiving.

Dad, do you feel like your father

was less of a man or something?

He might have not been gay.

A lot of straight guys like ass-play.

Yeah, maybe he was just too embarrassed to ask Grandma

-to use a dildo on him.

Oh, Jesus!

Can we not, please? Uh…

Even if he wasn’t a top, it doesn’t mean he was femme.

He could’ve still been butch, Dad.

Maybe he was a bossy bottom.

Yeah, maybe Grandpa was a power bottom.

Does that make you feel better?

No. That makes me wanna throw up.

Dad, you don’t wanna say that.

NICOLE: Well, he can say whatever he wants.

You know, if he’s having a negative visceral reaction

to his father having gay sex, it’s valid. It’s fine.

Well, it comes off as homophobic.

Well, it’s not.

Well, that’s how it comes across.

Well, luckily, he’s in a safe space

and he’s here with our family

so he can come off however he wants.

-Up to a point.

Or what? You’ll cancel him?

Dox him? Sic the K-Pop fans on him?

(SCOFFS) See what I have to deal with?

Mom, I need a new phone, stat. I’m gonna go completely insane.

You already are insane.

I’ll order it for you right now.

 (“HUKIA MAI A” BY KAPONO BEAMER PLAYING)

you were pretty horned up this morning.

(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

Wake up next to you, what do you expect?

Is it a problem?

Aren’t you horny for me?

-Yeah.

SHANE: Yeah.

Yeah. Just not like every single minute.

Like you are. (CHUCKLES)

Oh.

It’s just not the most important thing to me.

Well, what is?

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Well, is it the most important thing to you?

It’s up there. (LAUGHS)

So the– this entire marriage is just based on sex for you?

No. No.

Hey, all right. Look, there’s other stuff, too.

I love you.

And we’re a team. We get along great.

-Uh…

Yeah.

Oh my God.

You think that I’m like this… sex pig.

-Hey, look.

No.

SHANE: Me?

I can be romantic. I’m actually emo.

And don’t put me in a box.

-Thank you.

Sure.

SHANE: Hey, buddy. Hold on a second.

Hey, if you see Armond,

could you tell him I’d like to talk to him about something?

DILLON: Of course.

 (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) 

-It’s not about the room.

Oh.

(PHONE RINGING)

TANYA: Hello.

How are you this morning?

(ARMOND CHUCKLES)

I was hoping that you could help me.

I have something really important that I need to do.

I brought my mother’s ashes with me.

You know, so I could spread them in the ocean.

And I just realized yesterday, I’m gonna need a boat.

Oh, we have our resort boat you can charter.

TANYA: Is it free today?

‘Cause I really need to put this behind me.

Would you like to take it out at sunset?

Yeah, that would be nice.

Well, let’s say, uh, departure at 5:00 from the dock?

Can I get some alcohol on the boat?

I just– I think I might need a drink.

Of course. (CHUCKLES) Some fruit and cheese, maybe?

Could you just tell the captain…

that I think I’m gonna be a little emotional?

I just want him to be fully prepared.

Could be, like, a total basket case.

(CHUCKLES) Well, see you at 5:00.

But let’s definitely order the cheese.

-Mm-hmm.

TANYA: Thank you.

 (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) 

Uh, Christie, could you cover the desk?

CHRISTIE: Of course.

I just need to get something from the office.

 (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) 

(PILLS RATTLING)

-What?

DILLON: Uh, sorry.

I just wanted to tell you that Mr.

from the Palm Suite wants to talk to you.

Are you fucking kidding me?

What?

He thinks we ruined his honeymoon?

Fuck him! I will ruin his honeymoon.

Well, he’s eating by the pool, so…

I like your hair up like that. Looks cute.

Um, thanks.

(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

(GLASS CLINKING)

Can we have the phone sent here?

NICOLE: We’re not here long enough. It’ll be there when we get home.

Then I’m gonna need to use your computer, Mom.

Well, I do have work to do.

Like today, I’ve got Zooms all afternoon.

What the fuck am I supposed to do all day?

Enjoy Hawaii. Get in the ocean.

The o…

I did see a whale last night on the beach.

That was pretty cool.

NICOLE: Well, you’re not sleeping out there again.

Mom, he likes it. He’s communing with nature.

It’s funny how you’re able to have so much compassion

for all these groups of oppressed peoples

you don’t even know, and yet not for your family.

Yep, okay.

Who actually know you and love you.

Uh, yesterday I told you about a bag. It’s my friend’s.

Yeah. I left it on the beach. It’s olive green.

I checked with, uh, lost and found in the office,

and I’m so sorry to tell you, it wasn’t there.

But we’ll keep an eye out.

And if it turns up, I will call your room immediately.

I do hope we find it.

 (MUSIC FADES) 

Aloha, Mr. Ross.

Uh, Lana will take you to table nine. Thanks, Lana.

All right.

SHANE: I’ve been lookin’ for ya.

-Mr..

Hey.

-How are we this morning?

Yeah, no complaints.

Ah, love to hear that. (CHUCKLES)

Um, listen, I wanna do something special for my wife,

something kinda romantic. It’s our honeymoon.

I’m thinking a candlelit dinner totally off on our own.

Somewhere cool that’s like…

a beach or a cliff or just like…

like an Instagram spot, you know?

-Yes. Yes. How wonderful.

Yeah.

Um… And of course, we do private dinners

for couples all the time,

but since you’re such valued guests,

and with the whole mix-up regarding your room,

I would love to come up with something really unique.

Okay, great. Yeah. That’s– that’s what I’m thinking, too.

What about… a candlelit dinner on our charter boat at sunset?

That sounds perfect.

You can watch the sunset from a private cove.

Oh!

Schools of dolphins leaping and circling the boat

as you cruise the coastline,

-sipping piña coladas…

Nice.

…debating the names of your future offspring.

-I… I don’t know about that.

(ARMOND CHUCKLES)

-Well, that sound like a plan?

Yeah.

Well, see you down at the dock at 5:00.

-Okay, great.

ARMOND: Tonight then.

-Yeah. Thanks.

(CHUCKLES)

Oh, one little thing.

Uh, there will be one other guest on the boat.

Really?

Yeah. Very lovely woman, traveling alone,

and because she paid for the boat,

you’ll only have to pay for the dinner.

-Oh, yeah?

It’s a sizable boat.

You won’t even notice she’s there.

She’ll be quiet as a church mouse.

Yeah. All right. Yeah, that sounds fine.

I just…

I just want it to have a romantic vibe.

Absolutely. Oh, your wife is very lucky.

-Thank you for all the help.

Of course.

 (DRUM MUSIC PLAYING) 

BELINDA: Yes, we can do the total relaxation package

for you, not a problem.

Actually, can I give you a call right back?

-Hey!

Hey.

BELINDA: Thank you again for dinner last night.

Really, I had a great time. And it was cool,

you know, getting to know you more.

Yeah. You know, tonight’s the night

-I put my mother into the sea.

Oh, wow.

TANYA: The boat leaves at 5:00.

I’d really appreciate if you could be there.

(SIGHS) I’m here until 7:00.

Oh, geez. Well, uh…

You know what? I’ll take care of it.

I’m– I’m sure one of the girls will be able to cover for me.

This is important. I wanna be there for you.

Oh, thank you. Thank you.

-Yeah.

And just so you know,

I’m probably gonna be a little drunk,

so don’t judge me, all right?

-No. No, I’d never.

TANYA: Okay.

-Boat leaves at 5:00.

BELINDA: Five o’clock.

-All right.

BELINDA: I’ll see you.

All right.

QUINN: Dad.

MARK: What?

QUINN: If you don’t feel like doing this now, it’s fine.

Nah. (SIGHS)

It’s just like…

What is real? Like, what… You know? What’s real?

Are you gay?

No.

Hey. ‘Cause if you are, it’s okay.

-Just, like, be real.

I am being real.

What’s real is…

like, gay, straight, whatever, we’re just monkeys,

we’re just fucking monkeys.

-Yeah?

Yeah. Yeah, we’re just animals.

I mean, you know, we wanna be, like…

superheroes and respectable fathers

and pillars in our communities, whatever,

but– but in fact, we’re just monkeys…

living in our own little monkey pods,

driven by base instincts to create these hierarchies

and hump each other.

I thought I knew my father, you know?

I only knew the part that he wanted me to see.

He hid the monkey, and that screwed me up, Quinn.

-You think that’s what did it?

Yeah, definitely.

Hey, I thought–

My whole life, I thought I was the flawed child of an icon.

Like, I put him on this, like, enormous pedestal.

Meanwhile, like, he’s off in some bathhouse on the DL,

getting manhandled by some…

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) …like, random dudes.

(GROANS, CHUCKLES) Wow.

Oh, I wish I had known.

I’m sorry.

(SIGHING) Yeah.

But I get it. I mean, you know,

you don’t want your kid thinking you’re some sex-crazed lunatic.

 (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) 

The room is– is beautiful, and we have this ocean view,

and we face west, so we get these incredible sunsets.

Yeah.

You’d love Hawaii. Everything’s so lush.

Where we are, it isn’t so overdeveloped.

And there’s all of this amazing food and pastries.

Hey.

So, yesterday you were reading Freud and Nietzsche,

and today you’re reading what?

Oh. (CHUCKLES) So you finished Freud and Nietzsche.

Are you actually reading any of these books?

No, they’re just props.

We have a stylist choose our outfits

and then we have a book stylist pick out our books.

(LAUGHS) Yeah. That’s what I figured.

Yeah, it’s really relaxing.

I really wanna bring you and dad here.

Are you gonna get in the water?

Ye– well– you– you do!

I mean, everyone takes vacations.

Okay, so sixty pages, based on how fast you read,

that’ll be like two minutes, and then you can jump in.

(GIRLS LAUGH)

Do you wanna know me?

May– maybe.

Do you?

I don’t know.

Maybe it’s better if I’m just really real with you.

Maybe that’s the healthier legacy.

I think it is. Yeah.

and she wouldn’t let me touch her.

And then when I finally could,

I couldn’t get enough, man. I was…

I had to have it all the time. She thought I was nuts.

She thought that I should see a doctor.

-(CHUCKLES)

She thought I had, uh…

priapism.

Which is like when– Hey, bud.

When you get this perpetual hard-on,

like an erection that you– will not go down.

-Yeah.

MARK: But after a few years,

it doesn’t matter how much role playing you do

or, like, toys you buy

or porn you watch together, whatever,

sex just turns into, like, a–

You know like when they do one of those food challenges

on a reality show, you know,

where they gotta, like, eat like a bowl of live worms,

and you just got– you gotta psych yourself up for it.

You’re like, “I can do this. Just hold my nose

And she tried very, very hard to be a really good mother,

even though she didn’t have any maternal instincts or skills.

She, uh, she was always in search of male affection.

And, uh, she was…

a nymphomaniac.

I’d walk in her room and I’d find

all sorts of strange men in her bed.

She had borderline personality disorder.

She took her money

and she manipulated people with it.

And she was cruel. And she was very, very cruel.

She was so, so cruel and…

(SOBS)

I– I just– oh, mother, mother, mother, mother.

My mother…

told me I would never be a ballerina,

and that was when I was skinny.

My poor mother, she…

She just couldn’t handle her jealousy.

She had to take me down.

And what’s weird is I miss my mother

even though she was a big jerk!

I just– I need your help, everybody.

I– I’ve been trying for many days now

to open this box.

My poor mother’s in here.

I need someone to help me.

-Do you want me to open the box?

TANYA: Yeah, I would love that.

I’ll get it.

Um…

Yeah. Just…

(GRUNTING)

Oh my God, thank you.

SHANE: Yeah, no big deal. Yeah.

Mother.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Goodbye, Mother.

 (ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYING) 

Goodbye, Mother!

Goodbye, Mother! (GASPS)

(SOBS)

(WAILS)

I can’t– I can’t do this.

You know, this is– I just realized it’s too early for me.

-It’s okay.

(TANYA CRYING)

-(WAILING)

SHANE: All right.

Oh, I want my mother, mother, mother.

(CRYING)

-Hey let’s, uh, yeah– maybe–

TANYA: Oh, I can’t.

-Why don’t we– yeah, back in the box.

TANYA: I wanted my…

-(SIGHS) Oh, my God.

BELINDA: It’s okay.

(TANYA WAILING)

RACHEL: (GASPS) Oh my God.

BELINDA: It’s totally okay.

TANYA: No, it’s not okay!

I don’t understand what happened to your father.

I mean, I’ve been texting him all day.

I have his phone.

Well, you could’ve told me that earlier, Quinn.

You know, this is all because of you,

because you won’t share a giant room with your brother.

Mom, it works out perfect.

He can have the entire beach to himself to jerk off.

I don’t jerk…

Finish your sentence.

Whatever.

You’re addicted to porn.

QUINN: No, I’m not.

Yes, you are.

Don’t sex shame him.

Boys are sex shamed all the time now.

I mean, I know it’s very in, but it’s not okay.

(SNICKERING)

What?

You sex shame Dad.

I do not.

Okay. Whatever gets you through the night.

You– you’re gay, right?

-Yes, I’m gay.

No, my father was gay.

-Yes, I’m gay.

No, my father was gay.

I think. He, uh, he had sex with men.

That’s a telltale sign.

(BOTH LAUGH)

-Hey, can I ask you a question?

Hmm.

What’s it like, like, you know,

being fucked up the ass? Like, is that…

I mean, it must feel kinda good,

otherwise you wouldn’t keep doing it, right?

Does– does it feel good?

Do you wanna find out?

Uh, no, I’ll take a rain check.

 (DRUM MUSIC CONTINUES) 

Hutch.

When you’re young,

sex is powerful and intoxicating.

And as we mature, it gets demystified.

You realize there are more important things to focus on.

Like what? Zooming with China?

Like holding onto whatever shreds of dignity

you still have.

That’s so perverted.

-Can I take these?

Yes, thank you.

If you had the phone, did you see me texting all day?

And you didn’t respond, Quinn?

He did not tell us that she chartered that boat

for a goddamn funeral!

-It’s okay.

No, it’s not okay!

He did it on purpose.

-He’s fucking gaslighting me.

You have to let it go.

-I’m not gonna let it go.

Just let it go.

What I wanna do is go find that fucker.

Shane.

 (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) 

BELINDA: Okay, one second, let me just…

-(MUMBLING) What?

There you go.

-On the count of three.

Okay.

One, two, three. There you go.

-Good.

You’re a beautiful woman.

Oh, thank you, Tanya.

Is it– Okay! You got it.

Let’s just get the bottom half to join you.

There you go. Okay. All right.

-My head.

BELINDA: Oh.

-My head.

Let’s–

-Oh yeah.

(GRUNTS)

-That’s…

Oh– oh, oh!

-(GRUNTS)

BELINDA: (GRUNTS) There you go.

-All right.

Yeah.

-Okay.

Thank you.

Good night to her, and good night to you.

Everything’s gonna be okay.

TANYA: Mm-hmm?

BELINDA: Mm-hmm! You got it.

Hi.

How was the cruise?

-Not good.

Great.

Actually, it was a shit show.

-They’re fucking pissed.

Perfect.

Oh, do you want a drink? I, uh, I have tequila.

I have, uh…

-(PILLS RATTLE)

…other things.

Uh, no, no, I’m good.

I like this new hair look.

Yeah. Yeah. You said that already.

Turns out you’re my type. (CHUCKLES)

Blonde surfer with a man bun.

Okay.

You’re a great worker, Dillon.

Oh, um, well, thank you.

I have my eyes on you.

Okay. Well, I will talk to you later.

-All right. I’ll see you–

(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

Hmm, mm-hmm.

Why would he be gaslighting you?

This has happened before.

Like, people have been coming for me

my whole life.

I’m just playing the hand I was dealt.

Like, yeah. (SCOFFS) It’s a great hand.

And that’s not my fault.

Shane. Don’t worry about it.

I loved our dinner.

I thought it was really romantic…

(CHUCKLING) …until it wasn’t.

Yeah.

(INHALES)

(SHANE BREATHES HEAVILY)

Don’t. I’m not in the mood.

I’m just kidding. I’m always in the mood.

-Yeah?

SHANE: Yeah.

SHANE: Come on.
