I wouldn\u2019t go that far.  Well\u2026  Just talk to the guy.  Yeah. Yeah.  Is it\u2026 is it a big deal? Really?  Yeah.  Yeah?  It\u2019s our once-in-a-lifetime honeymoon. Yeah.  I just want it to be perfect for you, baba.  Mm, you\u2019re the sweetest. All right. I\u2019m gonna go talk to the guy.  Okay.  Maybe a blowjob first? What?  What? We had a 12-hour flight.  I\u2019m all horned up for you.  Shane, stop.  I\u2019m gonna talk to this guy with half a boner?  (GIGGLING) Stop it.  All right, yeah.  No, we\u2019ll save it for the right room.  Yeah.  All right.  Wait, I\u2019m gonna come with you.  SHANE: Okay! Hey.  Where\u2019d you go?  To the pool.  You know those girls from the boat,  the young ones?  They made me feel, like, really, really weird just now.  Baba.  What?  The guy lied.  I mean, that or he\u2019s just stupid or something.  We did book the room with the pool,  and we paid for it.  My mom forwarded me the booking.  Shane!  What?  I\u2019m not gonna let him ruin our honeymoon.  No. But he\u2019s not. You are.  Like, let\u2019s just enjoy this room. It\u2019s nice.  Just forget about the other room.  But we paid for it.  Get over yourself.  Get over myself?  Get over it.  Like, why are we even thinking about this?  Let\u2019s just enjoy our honeymoon, you know?  There\u2019s no problem.  Oh my God. Baba.  What?  It\u2019s our first marital spat.  Uh\u2026  Is that what you want? Are you looking for fights?  Not with you. I\u2019m not fighting.  Just come here. Come over here. Come here.  I won\u2019t mention it again. I\u2019ll take care of it. Okay?  I just want you have the best. The best.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, I bet those are the German fuckers that got our room. What?  That\u2019s all right.  You look beautiful.  Thank you. Or never. It\u2019s all good. It\u2019s all good. To\u2026 the adventure of a lifetime. There\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather be doing it with.  Cheers. We\u2019re married.  We\u2019re on our honeymoon.  Yeah. Yep.   I\u2019m happy. Yeah. Me, too.  I just hope that we don\u2019t become  like one of those old, depressing couples  with all this baggage and resentment and regrets.  And\u2026  I just hope it always stays this way, you know?  Yeah. It will, baba.  Promise?  Yeah.  Come here.   We are always gonna feel like this.  We will always be young.  And we will always be in love.  And there will be days and days just like this.  Okay?  Okay. Hey.  Buffet is decent.  What is it?  I just got an offer to do a piece.  Ah, you\u2019re on your honeymoon. Fuck that.  Yeah.  Does it sound good?  Oh, it\u2019s, um, about a YouTube influencer  who sponsored a Get Out The Vote campaign.  And then he took the five winners  to Burning Man in a\u2013 an electric RV  that can actually hover above the ground.  What? Fuck that.  Yeah.  But he got 80,000 teenagers to register to vote.  What are they gonna pay you?  -A few hundred dollars.  No way. Tell \u2019em no.  Well\u2026 Thank you.  I can\u2019t say no. If I keep saying no,  then they\u2019re\u2013 they\u2019re not gonna come to me anymore.  Like, if I want assignments, then I\u2013  I need to stay in the mix.  Yeah, but what? You\u2019re on your honeymoon.  You\u2019re gonna hole up in the hotel room,  just write some disposable garbage?  It\u2019s not garbage.  Yeah, fine, but it\u2019s like\u2013  it\u2019s like so many of the assignments they give you.  It\u2019s just clickbait gussied up as some, like,  high-minded trendy woke bullshit.  Plus, what does it matter if they stop calling? You don\u2019t need the money.  Yeah, but I spent years of my life  building these relationships.  Look\u2026  You did those jobs for dough. Right?  \u2018Cause you needed the work. And\u2026  I don\u2019t know, I hate to, like, blow your mind,  but your situation has changed.  Like, you don\u2019t need to do anything anymore.  Now you just do what you wanna do.  And whatever that is.  Well, that\u2019s very generous of you.  You\u2019re my wife. Come on.  You must\u2019ve thought about this.  The reality of that\u2019s, like, hard to process, you know?  Like, my parents were always broke,  and I haven\u2019t spent a day of my life, Shane,  where I wasn\u2019t hustling  or generally just worried about money.  Welcome to the rest of your wonderful life.  I\u2019ll be right back. Who are they?  Ah, it\u2019s the German couple that\u2019s staying in our room.  Mm.  He\u2019s a fucking liar. The husband?  No, the\u2013 no, the fucking dude at the fucking front desk.  You said he apologized.  Yeah.  He told me the Germans were leaving Wednesday  so we wouldn\u2019t have enough time to switch rooms and get in there.  They just told me they\u2019re flying back to Hamburg on Tuesday.  Well, then we can get into the room on Tuesday.  -What\u2019s the big deal?  Uh, he lied.  Well, maybe he just got it wrong.  No. He does not want us to have that room.  Why wouldn\u2019t he want us to have the room?  Why would he care?  I bet because he thinks I\u2019m an asshole.  Well, were you an asshole?  No.  No, I was actually trying to not be an asshole.  But you failed?  I\u2019ll call my mom, see if they  refunded the difference between the rooms.  So, I think I\u2019m gonna take the job.  What? Oh, you\u2019re joking.  I think I should do it.  You\u2019re gonna write an article  about a floating RV at Burning Man  while we\u2019re here?  I just\u2013 I can\u2019t just walk away from my career, Shane.  No one\u2019s asking you to walk away from your career.  We\u2019re on our honeymoon.  -Why are you so angry?  I\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m\u2026  \u2018Cause it\u2019s fucking weird.  You haven\u2019t worked for like the last couple months.  I was dealing with the wedding, and exactly.  You\u2019re gonna take a job while we\u2019re here?  That, to be honest, it\u2019s\u2026  That\u2019s rude. Okay? So, no.  No. Shane, you can\u2019t say no. Shane, it\u2019s my decision.  It doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense. You\u2019re gonna ruin our fucking honeymoon.  Is that what you wanna do? Ruin this whole thing? How about this? Whatever they\u2019re paying you, I\u2019ll double it.  You can get paid to have fun on your honeymoon, with me. That\u2013 that family\u2026 is so obnoxious.  The mother is a bitch.  And the daughter is a bitch also. There. I emailed them and I told them  that I\u2019m on my honeymoon and I cannot do the piece.  Are you happy?  Yeah. Thanks, baba.  Yeah. Whatever. Whatever.  Hey.  You know what I\u2019m gonna do for you?  -Hmm.  Because I love you so much.  Hmm.  I am gonna give you what every girl  in America wants, apparently.  A trip to Burning Man in an electric RV  that can levitate above the ground.  I love my wife.   My wife is so hot.  Stop.  I love my wife.  -My wife is so hot. My wife.  You\u2019re my wife.  My wife. Shit.  Oh, fuck!   That was amazing. Love you, Rach. Love you, too. I can\u2019t wait to fuck in Tahiti. So\u2026  you were pretty horned up this morning.  Yeah.  Wake up next to you, what do you expect?  Is it a problem?  Aren\u2019t you horny for me?  -Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. Just not like every single minute.  Like you are. Oh.  It\u2019s just not the most important thing to me.  Well, what is?  Well, is it the most important thing to you?  It\u2019s up there.  So the\u2013 this entire marriage is just based on sex for you?  No. No.  Hey, all right. Look, there\u2019s other stuff, too.  I love you.  And we\u2019re a team. We get along great.  -Uh\u2026  Yeah.  Oh my God.  You think that I\u2019m like this\u2026 sex pig.  -Hey, look.  No.  Me?  I can be romantic. I\u2019m actually emo.  And don\u2019t put me in a box. It\u2019s not about the room. Oh. Hey! You left me.  I\u2019m surprised that you noticed.  What? Oh, shut up!  You were so busy flirting with those girls.  I was not flirting with those girls.  I was giving them shit.  Well, it certainly seemed like you were having a good time.  Aw. Is my baby jealous?  No.  -Whatever.  Yeah.  Well, I came to find you to tell you  to wear something extra cute tonight.  What do you mean? Why?  I got a little something planned.  -Tell me.  No.  -Tell me.  No.  -Tell me.  It\u2019s a surprise.  Tell me.  But I will tell you,  it is very, very, very romantic. Oh! Wow! Is this all for us? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah? Oh, thank you so much. I love this.  This is nice.  Yeah.  Get a little tan.  It\u2019s getting warmer. We can\u2019t\u2013 we can\u2019t tell her not to bother us. Like, well, I\u2019m trying to have a romantic time with my wife. I can be romantic.  -See, right?  Yeah.  -I mean\u2026  Totally. Thank you.  You didn\u2019t have to do this, though.  I wanted to.  But is it because of our conversation this morning?  I guess I just get insecure, like\u2026 if our whole thing is based on your sexual attraction to me,  then what happens when that attraction fades?  Baba.  it is not going to fade.  -No?  No.  -Really? Mm-hmm. Oh my God. He did not tell us that she chartered that boat for a goddamn funeral!  -It\u2019s okay.  No, it\u2019s not okay!  He did it on purpose.  -He\u2019s fucking gaslighting me.  You have to let it go.  -I\u2019m not gonna let it go.  Just let it go.  What I wanna do is go find that fucker.  Shane. Why would he be gaslighting you?  This has happened before.  Like, people have been coming for me  my whole life.  I\u2019m just playing the hand I was dealt.  Like, yeah. It\u2019s a great hand.  And that\u2019s not my fault.  Shane. Don\u2019t worry about it.  I loved our dinner.  I thought it was really romantic\u2026   \u2026until it wasn\u2019t.  Yeah.   Don\u2019t. I\u2019m not in the mood.  I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m always in the mood.  -Yeah? Yeah. Come on.  Okay. But the truth is that what you said is completely right. Like, it is mostly clickbait for, like, no money. And, yeah, the industry does suck. But, like, there are people my age doing great work. And I\u2019m just not one of them. And maybe that\u2019s just \u2019cause I\u2019m not great. Like, I\u2019m just not excellent. Do you know what I\u2019m saying?  I think you\u2019re great. But I know what you mean.  Um\u2026 Maybe I just don\u2019t have, like, the drive like some people. And I\u2019m worried that now it\u2019s just gonna get worse.  \u2018Cause now you can afford expensive facials.  Come on, Shane. Just be serious. So, what I\u2019m thinking is maybe, if I really wanna make a difference, maybe I get involved in a great non-profit and\u2026 and I just put journalism on the back burner for a little while.  That\u2019s a great idea.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. That family is\u2026 That one, they are so weird. The dad is a perv, and the son always stares at my boobs.  Well\u2026 not as weird as What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? over here.  What?  Yeah, well\u2026 She\u2019s coming\u2013 she\u2019s coming over to the table. I was thinking that maybe if I miss journalism, then I can just come back\u2013 Shane. This guy\u2019s a fucking puke.  Shane.  Did you see that?  Shane. Shane.  He fully fucking ignored me.  I\u2019m trying to talk to you about my future.  I know. Okay, yup.  What do you think of that idea?  Um\u2026 I think it\u2019s, uh, good. I think it\u2019s cool.  This fucking guy. I\u2019m sorry. I gotta deal with this. This is\u2026 Rach Baba, why don\u2019t you tell my mom what you were thinking about? What was I thinking about?  What we were talking about this morning.  Oh, no, Shane, I don\u2019t wanna talk about that.  Come on!  No.  Come on, she could be helpful.  I didn\u2019t say that. Well, I mean, I think we all\u2026  Rachel, I do not see what the big deal is.  It\u2019s our honeymoon! It\u2019s so presumptuous. I mean, it\u2019s like\u2013 it\u2019s beyond.  Wha\u2013 Yeah. Well, my mother loves you.  No, she doesn\u2019t, Shane.  Yes, she does.  No, she doesn\u2019t. What if my mom showed up? How would you feel about that?  It\u2019d be fine. It\u2019d be just fine. Plus, it would never happen.  Oh, yeah? Why not? \u2018Cause she can\u2019t afford the plane ticket.   That is so fucked up. You have reached a number\u2026  You know what I mean.  \u2026is no longer in service.  Yeah, Shane, I know exactly what you mean.  I keep getting this message, \u201cThe number you dialed is not in service.\u201d It\u2019s a bogus number. Fuck this.  Where are you going?  I\u2019m gonna go ape shit on this guy.  Shane, wait\u2013 what\u2013 we\u2019re in the middle of a fight!  We have the rest of our lives to fight. How great is this, huh? Finally. Is there a bigger one? All right. I think I\u2019m gonna take a swim in the ocean. Oh, I\u2019ll come with you. No, no. It\u2019s all right. I\u2019m gonna go pretty far out. Wanna get some exercise. Really?  Yeah.  But I\u2026  I\u2019ll be back. It\u2019s a family we knew from the Bay Club. The kid\u2019s our age. His life\u2019s a total disaster. I think I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake. What\u2019s that? Hey, baba. Baba, you wanna get some brekkie? Rach? I booked a facial for this morning. Shane. Shane? It\u2019s my mom\u2019s travel agent. The dude is hardcore.  He knows one of the owners of the hotel.  He\u2019s gonna call. He\u2019s gonna raise hell.  Why?  Why? Listen to this.  Okay, you know the family that arrived on the boat with us, the ones you think are weird?  They went back to their room yesterday, and there\u2019s like a jewel thief in their fucking bedroom.  What?  Yeah.  There\u2019s like a fight and everything, and then the guy takes all their stuff.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he had a key to the room.  The only reason I know about this is \u2019cause the dad had a shiner and I asked him about it.  The hotel didn\u2019t tell us shit.  Like, if he\u2019s got a key to their room,  he could have a key to our room. Like, who fucking knows?  It\u2019s freaky.  I\u2019m serious.  We are in the biggest suite at the hotel.  We could be a target.  I just wish I had a gun or like a baseball bat at least, or something.  You know, like, fucking\u2026  Hmm. Yes!  Hold on.  That\u2019s the knife they gave us to cut the pineapples.  What, are you gonna cut a bunch of pineapples?  Gonna keep this by the bed. Gotta protect my hot wife.  This Armond guy is unbelievable. He\u2019s going down.  Shane.  Lorenzo\u2019s all over it. Oh, how was your facial?  Your face looks nice and shiny.  Shane.  What?  What?  I\u2026 I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying this, but, uh\u2026 I think I made a mistake.  What\u2019s the mistake?  The mistake is\u2026 the mistake is\u2026 getting married\u2026 to you.  What?  Shane, when I met you, I was\u2026 in a weird place. And, uh\u2026 I had my bad breakup, and work was so frustrating. And\u2026 And then you came along, and you\u2019re so handsome, and I was so attracted to you, and you had so much going on, and\u2026 going around the city with you was like a fantasy. All the doors opened, and then you asked me to marry you, and\u2026 And look, I admit, when I was little, I had princess dolls, and\u2026 I was a girly girl and I dreamt about my wedding day and\u2013 and Prince Charming and all that shit.  What the fuck are you talking about?  And then I\u2013  Are you for real right now?  And then I got caught up in the wedding, and that was the last five months, basically. And everyone, you know, I could tell thought I was so lucky, and that made me feel good. But like in the dumbest way. Because\u2026 Because now I\u2019m here and\u2013  And what?  And\u2026 I realize\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna be a plus one my whole life.  Okay, so don\u2019t be.  I mean, I\u2019m not telling you to be anything.  But that\u2019s just how it is.  Okay, so are you blaming me \u2019cause you\u2019re not more successful?  No, I\u2019m not blaming you for anything. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.  What a relief. Like\u2026  After I\u2019ve wined you and dined you and asked you to marry me, and then made you the center of my life, it\u2019s just nice to know you\u2019re not pissed.  Shane, this is about me. I\u2019m not okay with being a trophy wife, an appendage like all these other women in your world.  Okay, so you\u2019re pretty and that\u2019s part of the appeal for me, and what, that bothers you?  I just need to respect myself.  I gotta hand it to you. Ah\u2013 You\u2013  You hid yourself really well, Rachel. I mean, this whole time, I bought that you were this cool chick who was fun and confident and normal. And I had no idea that you were this insecure, na\u00efve baby.  You\u2019re the baby, Shane. Coddled by your mommy, who showed up on your honeymoon. You don\u2019t get the room you want, so you throw a never-ending tantrum. I genuinely cannot believe what a baby-man you can be.  Okay, I\u2019m out.  I\u2019m gonna go for a swim.  Because now, we are starting down a very dark road, and you better be sure you really wanna go there.  Rachel. What? You should double bolt the door. I told you, there\u2019s a violent criminal running around the hotel. Something going on with that guy.  Will you leave that poor man alone?  Look, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you exactly.  But when you stop spiraling out and you come back to Earth, I\u2019ll be here.  I\u2019m here for you.  I\u2019m your husband.  And I love you.   What is going on?  I\u2019m sorry.  Why are you doing this?  Why are you ruining everything?  I\u2019m sorry.  I mean, Jesus Christ, Rachel.  Like, are you for real right now?  What the fuck is going on? So, what\u2019s the problem? I mean, there is no problem, everything\u2019s perfect.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, so, then\u2026 what?  I just feel\u2026 When I\u2019m with you, I feel just\u2026 weirdly\u2026 alone.  Uh.  Okay.  Then be alone. Everything\u2019s fine. I\u2019m happy, promise. I\u2019ll\u2013 I\u2019ll be happy. Oh, thank God.", "from": "SHANE", "to": "RACHEL", "width": 1}, {"dialogue": "Oh, Mr. Patton and Ms. Undecided.   You finding everything to your liking?  Uh, actually, I think you put us in the wrong room.  We\u2026 we\u2019re supposed to be in the honeymoon suite.  Oh, there is no honeymoon suite.  Well, uh, we\u2019re supposed to have  a plunge pool on a private patio.  Oh, well, that would be the, uh, the Pineapple Suite.  Okay.  But\u2026  I\u2026 yeah, I don\u2019t have a\u2026  A record of you booking that room, no.  Uh, my mother sent a virtual tour.  She booked the room.  Uh, well, you\u2019re paying for a presidential ocean view suite.  Um, the Palm. That\u2019s a very nice room.  Totally unique.  Right.  It\u2019s really nice, yeah.  But no plunge pool.  But you still have the infinity pool,  the waterfall pool, and the fountain pool.    Right.  The Pineapple Suite, it has the private pool  but it doesn\u2019t have the ocean view.  Um, I think the privacy would be nice, right?  I don\u2019t know. Maybe I should call my mother?  Do you wanna call your mother?  What do you think she\u2019ll say?  I think she\u2019s gonna say we\u2019re in the wrong room, but\u2026  Well, the Pineapple Suite  isn\u2019t available, I\u2019m afraid, anyway.  Oh, it\u2019s not?  No. There\u2019s a German couple staying there.  They also just got married.  So\u2026 it is a honeymoon suite.  Shane.  No, I just\u2026 Oh, well, the Palm is everyone\u2019s favorite.  I prefer the Palm to the Pineapple. Uh-huh.  Okay. Um\u2026  All right.  That\u2019s a bummer.  I saw the virtual tour of it, and it\u2019s\u2026  We\u2019re definitely not paying for the more expensive room?  No.  Right?  I mean, yes, you are not.  Okay. Is there anything else I can help you with, or\u2026 No, that\u2019s\u2026 Sir! Hey, sir. Hey. Y\u2026 yes?  Um, I have an email here\u2026 uh, about the booking.  Can I talk to you about this in just a minute?  Uh, yeah. No problem. Yeah. Whenever.  \u2018Scuse me.  Hey, excuse me. Hey, buddy.  -Excuse me.  Ah, Mr..  -How are you this morning?  Yeah. Okay.  So I have this email here, forwarded from my mother.  Oh, an email from your mother.  Okay. Okay.  So, yesterday you said  that we paid for the room that we have.  But actually we did pay more money  for the room we don\u2019t have. So\u2026  I assure you, your mother is only paying  the rate for your current room.  Right.  You guys made a mistake.  Okay? So just\u2026  just own up to your mistake, it\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.  Well, if there\u2019s been a mistake, I do apologize.  I\u2019m so very sorry.  Thank you.  Um, mistakes happen, you know,  but I\u2019m just on my honeymoon, you know,  and, uh, it\u2019s just not the kind of trip  where you wanna be impacted negatively  -by someone else\u2019s mistake.  Oh, of course not.  Right, so, I guess I\u2019m just wondering what, uh,  you might be able to do for us to make us feel better  about the whole situation?  Well, as I told you yesterday,  the Pineapple Suite is occupied.  Right. When are they leaving?  The Volkmers are departing the day before you, on Wednesday.  And due to our new cleaning policy,  there would not be enough time to get you in there.  Okay. Um\u2026  Do you think we can get another kind of upgrade?  Well, you and your wife are in the biggest suite.  Besides the Pineapple Suite.  There is another suite in the same category,  with a slightly bigger floor plan  because it has a second powder room.  Okay.  I could see if it\u2019s available.  Would you like a second toilet?  Yeah. Great.  Yeah, it\u2019s a garden suite, so no ocean view,  but it does have that second toilet.  Um, no. That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s all right.  Look, you are a valued guest, Mr..  And I sense your frustration.  Yeah.  Since I can\u2019t get you the other room, um,  I am hopeful there\u2019s some other way  we can make this up to you.  Let me think on it, okay?  -You go enjoy your day.  Okay.  -And I\u2019ll come find you later.  Yeah.  -Okay.  Okay.  All right. Thanks. Mr. and Mrs., good evening. I come bearing gifts,  a complimentary bottle of Veuve Clicquot. May I pour? Wonderful.  I am so very sorry for all the confusion\u2026  and I am determined  to get you into the Pineapple Suite  before you leave.  There we are.    Please enjoy. I\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 for ya.  -Mr..  Hey.  -How are we this morning?  Yeah, no complaints.  Ah, love to hear that.  Um, listen, I wanna do something special for my wife,  something kinda romantic. It\u2019s our honeymoon.  I\u2019m thinking a candlelit dinner totally off on our own.  Somewhere cool that\u2019s like\u2026  a beach or a cliff or just like\u2026  like an Instagram spot, you know?  -Yes. Yes. How wonderful.  Yeah.  Um\u2026 And of course, we do private dinners  for couples all the time,  but since you\u2019re such valued guests,  and with the whole mix-up regarding your room,  I would love to come up with something really unique.  Okay, great. Yeah. That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, too.  What about\u2026 a candlelit dinner on our charter boat at sunset?  That sounds perfect.  You can watch the sunset from a private cove.  Oh!  Schools of dolphins leaping and circling the boat  as you cruise the coastline,  -sipping pi\u00f1a coladas\u2026  Nice.  \u2026debating the names of your future offspring.  -I\u2026 I don\u2019t know about that.  -Well, that sound like a plan?  Yeah.  Well, see you down at the dock at 5:00.  -Okay, great.  Tonight then.  -Yeah. Thanks.   Oh, one little thing.  Uh, there will be one other guest on the boat.  Really?  Yeah. Very lovely woman, traveling alone,  and because she paid for the boat,  you\u2019ll only have to pay for the dinner.  -Oh, yeah?  It\u2019s a sizable boat.  You won\u2019t even notice she\u2019s there.  She\u2019ll be quiet as a church mouse.  Yeah. All right. Yeah, that sounds fine.  I just\u2026  I just want it to have a romantic vibe.  Absolutely. Oh, your wife is very lucky.  -Thank you for all the help.  Of course.  Hey, man. Hey, man. Excuse\u2013 Hey! Dude? Oh, Mr., good morning.  Did you not see me in the restaurant just now?  I\u2019m sorry?  I\u2019m waving to you, I\u2019m shouting\u2013 I know you saw me.  I was sent to fetch a bag.  You looked right at me and you kept walking.  My apologies. So sorry. Oh, how was your candlelit dinner last night?  Yeah, that\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about. Uh, it fucking blew, frankly.  Oh, no.  Yeah. You put us on a boat with a crazy lady who was having some kind of fucking memorial service. You knew! You knew that she was out there to spread her dead mother\u2019s ashes on the goddamn ocean.  Oh, well, she might\u2019ve mentioned that.  I\u2019m trying to do a romantic gesture for my wife. I got a crazy lady who\u2019s having some kind of fucking nervous breakdown. So no, it was not romantic. It was a dumpster fire shit show!  I had no idea. I\u2019m sorry your vacation isn\u2019t everything you\u2019d hoped\u2013 so far. But the good news, there\u2019s an exciting surprise you\u2019ll be receiving later today.  What? We\u2019re gonna get in our room?  Unfortunately, no.  Jesus.  But I think this is really gonna turn things around.  Then I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want a free massage. I don\u2019t want cheap champagne. What I want is to speak to your boss.  Well, I am the resort manager.  Yeah, but you have a boss. Who is your boss?  Our general manager, Mr. Zeoli, is at a conference this week.  Yeah, I want to get in touch with him. Can I have his number?  I\u2019ll have him call you.  No! No. I\u2019m calling him.  I will have someone bring you his business card with his cell phone number to your room. And you can call him at your leisure.  Good. This morning, please. Now, I know you said you didn\u2019t want my surprise, but I took the liberty of bringing it anyway.  What is it?  Well\u2026 Dinner reservation for three? Yeah. Hello. Mr., are you enjoying your mother?  You said you were gonna bring me that number of the general manager? You forgot to give it to me?  Yes, of course. I\u2019ll get that to you. Not a problem.  Just bring it to dinner.  Bye-bye. Hey, can I get that number now? Oh, I was just about to hand it to you. Uh-huh. Aloha,s.  Hi.  How are we this morning?  Yeah. We\u2019re good.  How are you?  I\u2019m very well, thank you.  I have some very good news for you.  I think you\u2019ll be pleased to hear.  Uh, the Volkmers have just checked out of the Pineapple Suite.  Oh! And I have made it the top priority of our housekeeping team.  So we should be able to get you in there by midday today.  Great. Well, Mr. Patton  Hmm.  Hope you\u2019ll be happy here. Um\u2026  And because of all the\u2026 difficulties we\u2019ve had, I\u2019d like to offer you the room free of charge.  Sounds good.  You know, I want us to be\u2026 copacetic. Yeah. I bet.  Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, fuck. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry.

The travel agent, sweetie.  We always use him. He\u2019s a shark.  Yeah, yeah, get him in on it.  Should I?  Yeah, why not.  That\u2019s what travel agents are for, right?  He\u2019ll deal with it.  She\u2019s gonna have Lorenzo call.  They\u2019re gonna regret this.  Lorenzo is a gay Filipino beast. Ta-da! Mom. Am I interrupting? SHANE: Mom.  KITTY: I know it\u2019s only your honeymoon.  SHANE: What are you doing here? Hey!  KITTY: Aw.  Listen, I know this isn\u2019t kosher, and I told him to keep it a secret because I knew you would say no.  Get outta here. Come on, come on, come on, come on.  I was just so tense from the wedding and all the weeks leading up to it. I know you were too. And then Cathy Clement\u2013 I swear this was Cathy Clement\u2019s idea. She said, \u201cWe should do a spa week at the Mauna Kea.\u201d And of course that sounded amazing. And then I talked to you on the phone, honey, and you sounded so upset. You had me worried. And I thought, you know, maybe I\u2019ll just pop over and see you guys for a second and give you a little love and then be on my way and go meet Cathy at the Mauna Kea. Please don\u2019t be mad at your mother-in-law.  Oh, my God. Of course not. I\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m really, really happy to see you.  Oh, good. That makes me so happy. This is a really nice view. It\u2019s a really nice room. But it\u2019s definitely not the room I booked.  Trust me, I know.  Why did they give you this room, I wonder?  Mother\u2026 Don\u2019t even start. It\u2019s\u2026  Hmm? It\u2019s a touchy subject, huh?  Yeah. I can\u2019t believe my baby boy is married. I can\u2019t believe it! Aw. I am so glad we had so many cameras. The whole thing is an absolute blur.

You really have to wear\u2013 Did you get earplugs?  I know.  I really like this textured paper over here on this wall. So pretty. I wanna get that, don\u2019t you? Gives it some character.

Rachel\u2019s thinking about quitting journalism. Hmm. She still wants to make a difference, but, uh, she finally figured out journalism is a sucker\u2019s game. So, uh, she was thinking about getting involved with a non-profit. I know, Mom, you do a bunch of shit with charities, so, you know. Shane, doesn\u2019t this remind you of the heritage house where we stayed in Manila? Uh\u2026 The open feeling? Yeah. Mom, what\u2013 Mom, what is your point?  My point is I read somewhere in Conde Nast that said this was the most romantic hotel in Hawaii, and I thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019s where they need to go.\u201d  Because my baby deserves the best.  Thanks, Mom.  Well, if you\u2019d like to put your luggage together, I\u2019ll have the bellman move them over when the room is ready.

And I came by your office last night just to let you know the number wasn\u2019t working but, uh, you were occupied.  Well, very sorry about that.  Yeah.  And you were really, really busy.  And so late at night. Well, enjoy your breakfast. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the most romantic hotel in Hawaii, do you? It\u2019s perfectly fine, but are you finding it very romantic? It\u2019s okay. How great is this, huh? Finally. All right. I think I\u2019m gonna take a swim in the ocean. Oh. Bye, Mom. See you later, honey. Have a nice swim. Yeah. He tells everybody he\u2019s going to the office every day, but really, he\u2019s just sitting in his car gambling online.  What?  Carol told me he was doing great.  She said he got some big promotion\u2026  No.  \u2026recently. No?  Mom.  Hmm.  He\u2019s about half a million dollars in debt.  Hmm.  His wife left him.  She took the kid.  She\u2019s living with her folks. He\u2019s dating a stripper.  Last I heard, he\u2019s staying in an Airbnb near the airport.  So, yeah.  Things are going real great.  Shane, you\u2019re too much. There was always something a little off with the Cutlers. Yeah. They were always trying a little too hard, you know? You know, I knew they had money, but I could never figure out what the father did, Gavin.  Hmm. Then one day, I\u2019m at the bookstore and I see a book written by Gavin Cutler.  What?  Turns out he\u2019s a writer of crime fiction. Isn\u2019t that insane?  (LAUGHING) You gotta be kidding me.  Everybody\u2019s got to make their money somehow. Goodbye.

Well, I guess it\u2019s not stealing when you think everything\u2019s already yours.  Just stop pretending to be my friend.  I\u2019m just some prop you use for some weird cred.  Whatever you did, Paula, it was really fucked up.  My mom could\u2019ve gotten really hurt.  Something bad could\u2019ve happened.  Something bad did happen. I fucked up everything. It\u0027s okay.

Well, that\u2019s how it comes across.  Well, luckily, he\u2019s in a safe space  and he\u2019s here with our family  so he can come off however he wants.  -Up to a point.  Or what? You\u2019ll cancel him?  Dox him? Sic the K-Pop fans on him? Mom, he likes it. He\u2019s communing with nature. It\u2019s funny how you\u2019re able to have so much compassion  for all these groups of oppressed peoples  you don\u2019t even know, and yet not for your family.  Yep, okay.  Who actually know you and love you.  Your generation\u2019s only sacred value.  -Biting the hand that feeds you.  Whatever.  Oh, good. Hi, girls.  Can you just help me move this bed in?  I just\u2013 I just need to do it real quick.  Mom, there\u2019s meds for this.  No, it\u2019s just for my Zoom.  I finally found a good background,  -but I can see the bed.  So what?  Well, so I don\u2019t want my entire organization  and my Chinese affiliates  knowing that I\u2019m on fucking vacation!  Olivia, can you just help me with the bed, please?  -I have five minutes.  Okay, fine!  Thank you.  Okay. All right, girls, ready? One, two, three.   -Just lift it!  Push.  Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!   All right, I\u2019m gonna start my Zoom.  And you guys, if you\u2019re gonna stay in here,  you have to be totally silent.  Okay? And stay out of the frame. Mom, you look deranged. It\u2019s all right. I have a filter for that. Oh, fuck. Olivia, get down! Ow. I don\u2019t understand what happened to your father. I mean, I\u2019ve been texting him all day.  I have his phone.  Well, you could\u2019ve told me that earlier, Quinn. You know, this is all because of you, because you won\u2019t share a giant room with your brother.  Mom, it works out perfect.  He can have the entire beach to himself to jerk off. Don\u2019t sex shame him.  Boys are sex shamed all the time now.  I mean, I know it\u2019s very in, but it\u2019s not okay.  What?  You sex shame Dad.  I do not.  Okay. Whatever gets you through the night. When you\u2019re young, sex is powerful and intoxicating.  And as we mature, it gets demystified.  You realize there are more important things to focus on.  Like what? Zooming with China?  Like holding onto whatever shreds of dignity  you still have.  That\u2019s so perverted. Girls! All right, girls, let\u2019s get breakfast. The buffet is expensive, and we\u2019ve already paid for it. Mom, Paula can\u2019t keep eating this much fruit. Why not? She keeps getting diarrhea. Did Quinn sleep on the beach again last night? This is not okay. You\u2019ve got to be more protective of your younger brother, Olivia. You can\u2019t just make him sleep on the beach where he can be washed away with the tides. Or end up in a bukkake with a pod of dolphins. He doesn\u2019t have any friends. Of course he does. Hiroki Takeuchi. Hiroki Takeuchi moved back to Japan. What? When? Like two years ago. How\u2019s it going? \u2026 Hey, can I ask you girls a favor? Can you try to include Quinn a little bit more in your voodoo ceremonies and whatever else you do? Mom, he\u2019s scuba diving in the kiddie pool. No, I know, just in general. You know, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t think you appreciate how tough things are for kids like Quinn right now.  Why? Because of the Asperger\u2019s?  He doesn\u2019t have Asperger\u2019s, Olivia. But he is a straight, white, young man. And nobody has any sympathy for them right now. And I just feel like we should. Yeah, in a way, they\u2019re the underdogs now.  Yeah, don\u2019t you have enough of them on staff? Trust me, I get it. I\u2019m just saying, I understand how guys like Quinn can feel a little alienated from the culture right now. Mom, cringe. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to him. Mom, cringe. Olivia, he\u2019s my son, okay? Okay. Paula\u2019s meds are missing. And so we need to go find them. It\u2019s urgent. She\u2019s not gonna have like a seizure or something? Olivia, Come on. Mom, good news. I\u2019m looking around the hotel, and it seems like all of the white, straight men are doing just fine. They\u2019re still thriving. Point taken. I just think it\u2019s funny that now it\u2019s okay to reduce everybody to their race and gender, but isn\u2019t that the kind of thinking that we\u2019ve been fighting against all these years? Hmm, no, that\u2019s just you, Mom. And what\u2019s your system of belief, Olivia? Not capitalism. Not socialism. So just cynicism? Mom, do you have any aspirin? Paula has a migraine.  I have some Advil in my, um, makeup bag.  Wha\u2013 She\u2019s allergic to Ibuprofen.  Of course she is. Don\u2019t you have anything else?  Um\u2026  What\u2019s wrong?  I have some Aleve in my purse in\u2013 in the bar. Enjoy being on the water. It\u2019s a fun excursion with the whole family. Yeah, Mom, you seem thrilled. Paula was disturbed by the entertainment. The hula dancing? Oh. I think it\u2019s just a way for them to honor their culture.  And they seemed to be having a really good time.  What\u2019s the code to the safe? Ten twenty-six. Ten twenty-six? Aw. That\u2019s my birthday, Mom. We had to get Paula some Dramamine. Uh-hmm, right, okay.  I love how you drive us on these family outings, but you spend the entire time on your phone.  It\u2019s a work e-mail, honey.  Oh, I know it\u2019s just so pathetic having a job that pays for the vacation.  God. Mom, what\u2019s with the Tourette\u2019s? Whatever, Olivia. I don\u2019t need this from my own fucking family.  I\u2019m tired of being the fucking punching bag. What?  God. Guess she really does have issues. Go help her. Pull her hair back.   Go, go, go. She needs\u2013 Yeah. See how it\u2019s getting in her hair?  Yeah, pull it\u2013 Both sides, get the other side.  Yeah, there you go. Now hold on.  Paula, I\u2019m gonna get you a 7 Up, sweetie.  Thank you so much.

You wouldn\u2019t even believe it.  All these guests are crazy. Hey. Hey.  What\u2019s up?  Sorry. I couldn\u2019t get away.  Come on. I got a surprise for you.  So, uh, I found us an empty room and, uh\u2026 I stole a master out of one of the housekeeper\u2019s carts.  Really?  Yeah. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving soon.  I just\u2013 I want you to stay.  I know.  But it\u2019s not up to me. It\u2019s my friend\u2019s family.  Your friend\u2026 she\u2019s a jerk.  What?  What about her?  Well\u2026  Tell me.  After the show, she came up to me, and she was kind of, like, batting her eyes and sticking out her tits.  Seriously?  Was she hitting on you?  Well, kind of, yeah.  But I wasn\u2019t gonna do anything, you know?   What\u2019s the big deal? I thought\u2013  I thought you said you didn\u2019t tell her about us.  She knows.  You told her?  No, but she knows.  That\u2019s why she\u2019s hitting on you.  That\u2019s her twisted fucking thing.  Paula, don\u2019t stress. Come here. Look at me.  I only want you.    I made you this.  It\u2019s beautiful.  You like it?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah. Try it on.  I, uh, I think you should really stay. I mean\u2026  I know my place isn\u2019t big, but you\u2019ll fit.  I mean, we\u2019d have so much fun, you know?  I\u2013 I\u2019m not staying.  I have college and a whole life to get back to, and\u2026  honestly, Kai, I\u2013 I doubt we\u2019ll ever see each other again.  I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2019m just being straight with you.  Yeah.  Okay.  But I\u2026  I really like you.  I really do, and\u2026 I feel for you, and\u2026 your situation and your family, and\u2013 and everything you told me, and\u2026 maybe I could help you.  Help me?  How?  I could give you something.  I\u2013 well, I can\u2019t really give it to you, but\u2026  I can help you take it. Hi. What\u2019s up?  Now is the time.  Now?  We\u2019re going on a dive boat. We leave the dock at 3:00.  She\u2019s not gonna bring her jewelry with her on the boat.  Look, I\u2013 I don\u2019t know about this, Paula.  Just one of those bracelets, just one, is worth 75,000 dollars.  Kai, think what you can do with that.  You know, you could finally hire a good lawyer to fight these fuckers.  Oh, shit. Paula, I\u2013  You can help your brothers.  They won\u2019t give you shit for taking this job, that\u2019s for sure, not after the way you come through for them like this.  I just\u2013 I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t steal from people, you know?  They stole from you.  They stole all of this from you. You know that.  But it\u2019s different. It\u2019s\u2013 It\u2019s different people.  No, they\u2019re the same people. They\u2019re all the same people.  Don\u2019t you see they\u2019re all the same people?  All of these people, at some point, have stolen from someone like you.  And they don\u2019t need it. They won\u2019t even miss it.  They have all this money, and they don\u2019t even know what to do with it.  And then there\u2019s someone like you who\u2019s struggling.  I know, but\u2013  That\u2019s not right.  I agree. But I just\u2013 Aren\u2019t these people, like, your friends? Like\u2013  They\u2019re not my friends.  No, they\u2019re not my friends.  Holy shit, Paula, I don\u2019t know.  We leave the hotel Thursday and there might not be a better time than now.  You still have that master key, right?  So it\u2019ll get you into our suite? Yeah.  The code to the safe is 1026.  It\u2019ll be easy.  And you can finally get the money to fight and get back everything that was stolen from you.  Look, you can do what you want, but at 3:00 p.m., the suite will be empty.  Okay.

I should call my Uncle Charlie and find out.  It\u2019s just\u2026 so disturbing  that it\u2019s in my balls, and that they get big like this.  It\u2019s very Gogol.  Mark, whatever it is, you\u2019re gonna be fine.  People get cancer. They deal with it.  It\u2019s not like it was when your dad had it.  And you know what?  They\u2019re making breakthroughs every day.  It\u2019s like a nonstop parade of progress.  You know what? This is terrible timing.  Coming here was nuts.  Look at your son.

Hello. It\u2019s gonna be okay, Mark. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s gonna be good news.  Good things happen to good people. Honey, the kids are so happy. I just told them, and they\u2019re thrilled. Oh, good, honey. Let\u2019s get breakfast. Okay. Ugh. Honey, what are you doing?  I\u2019m cleaning up. No, you\u2019re rearranging the hotel room.  No, I\u2019m improving our space.  Stop moving furniture, Nic.  We\u2019re here for a week. I need nice feng shui. Does he have to slam every door? That pretty girl who was on the boat with us  was at the pool today.  She said she was a fan. Thank you. That\u2019s so sweet, honey. I was texting you all day, and then Quinn told me he had your phone. Hmm, mm-hmm. You\u2019re taking this really hard. Get off me, monkey. Get off me. I mean it. What\u2019d you do all day?  I did scuba.  Mm-hmm. And the eight hours after that?  I drank beer at the Kahuna.  Mm. Well, we ended up eating dinner at the restaurant. It wasn\u2019t very festive.  I\u2019m sorry. I was depressed. I kept thinking about how my dad chose his sex life over his family.  Well, that sounds familiar.  And it literally killed him. So I never really got to know him, you know? Well, are you gonna participate today, or are you gonna go on another bender?  Participate! Happy, happy. Jesus Christ. We should\u2019ve let him bring a friend. I agree. I mean, for years, I was the good guy, you know? I was the one in the room, saying, like, \u201cHey, that\u2019s not cool,\u201d to all the chauvinists and bigots. But now I\u2019m the bad guy, or at least, I shouldn\u2019t say anything on account of my inherited traits. I mean, why do I need to prove my anti-racist bona fides? It seems wrong. Why did you tell the kids how much you spent on my bracelets?  I just told Quinn.  I don\u2019t know, I just think it makes us\u2026 sound kind of materialistic.  I mean, without the context, you know, of why you bought them.  Well, I gave him the context.  What?  I did. I gave him the context.  We were having a conversation about sex and relationships and men and women, and I just wanted to be real with him.  But we agreed to not do that.  Well\u2026 \u2026look, I wanna have an honest relationship with my son.  Okay.  But, Mark\u2026 I am very curious to hear what you said exactly.  I said that I had an affair, and that I regretted it, and that it\u2013 it was the worst period of my life.  That\u2019s exactly what I said.  Do you see how that\u2019s selfish, Mark?  Well, I think he took it pretty well.  Selfish in regards to me.  To me.  Because I have a relationship with him too.  And now I\u2019m gonna have to talk to Quinn and explain how I feel about it all, and why I never told him about it, and then I\u2019m gonna have to have a similar conversation with Olivia.  And I don\u2019t wanna have to talk about it with them.  I don\u2019t wanna have to talk about it at all.  I\u2019m on vacation.  I\u2019m trying to unwind from the stress that is my life.  Well, I think it can wait.  I mean, it\u2019s not like he had a lot of follow-up questions, and I don\u2019t think he wants to talk about it either.  No, yeah, yeah. N\u2026  Nobody wants to talk about your affair, Mark\u2026  which is why we agreed to not talk about it.  \u2018Cause I\u2019m still in a lot of pain.  And it still hurts me a lot.  And I want it to be over.  And I want it to be behind us.  And you bring it up again? Here?  Why?  I\u2019m sorry.  Mark, your truth changes from minute to minute.  You\u2019re up, you\u2019re down. One minute, you\u2019re dying.  The next minute, y\u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful life.  Okay. Well, maybe I should be more like you then.  But even if I could be some self-protective corporate robot out in the world, I still couldn\u2019t pull it off at home.  Do you ever edit yourself at all?  Even when you\u2019re apologizing, you\u2019re so insulting. It\u2019s not healthy to be so honest all the time. Hey, one last thing. What?  And then let\u2019s put it to bed.  I was just realizing that the reason I\u2013 I told Quinn is because if I can\u2019t give him a lot of reasons for him to respect me as a man, then maybe if I\u2019m just honest about my failures\u2026 maybe he\u2019ll respect me for that.  Mark.  I mean\u2026 I just need someone in my life to respect me, you know?  Are you serious?  Oh, come on. I didn\u2019t\u2013  \u201cCome on,\u201d what?  I mean, it\u2019s not like you act like you do.  Okay, I\u2019m gonna go.  What?  I\u2019m not in the mood anymore.  Nic, come on.  I\u2019m fucking over this. Thank you.  Why am I the fucking punching bag?  All I do is everything I possibly can.  And just because I fucking hold everything fucking together, everybody gets to fucking poke?  Nic, come on, Nic.

So sweet here. Yes!  Yes!  Hey!  The visibility was amazing.  Oh, that\u2019s great. No, it was easy. Awesome. I think we should finally buy that boat. Mark, we\u2019re not getting a boat.

Hey\u2026 Wait\u2026 Belinda. Belinda. Belinda, it\u2019s me. Ooh.  Belinda\u2026  You\u2026  you, you\u2019re so good at this.    -Feeling better?  Oh my God.  Was that really 90 minutes?  \u2018Cause, oh my God, it\u2013 it felt like ten.  I think you fell asleep.  Oh my God. I know I fell asleep because I\u2026  I dreamt that I was on the top  of this beautiful mountain range in Asia.  Oh, that\u2019s cool.  And I had a cyanide pill.  And I just\u2026  Listen, you\u2013 you are so talented.  -Thank you.  You know, most people,  they really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.  You know, they\u2013 they lie you down and\u2026  and then you just get lubricated. But\u2026  you\u2026  you really know where you\u2019re going.    Do you think you could have dinner with me  at the hotel tonight? Come on.  \u2018Cause I woke up this morning and I swear to God,  I felt better today than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life,  and I just really need to know how you did that.  The hotel doesn\u2019t really like it  when the staff interacts with the guests in that way.  What do you mean? You can\u2019t have dinner?  It would be unusual.  Like some kind of caste system?  Tanya, thank you so much for the invitation.  -I really appreciate it.  That\u2019s absurd.  We can have dinner. Who do I to talk to?  You know what? Um\u2026  I\u2019ll talk to Armond, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.  Yeah, it will be fine. Yeah.  Um, I get off at 7:00.  Yeah, that\u2019s good. I mean, like a couple minutes  after 7:00 at the\u2013 at the restaurant.  Sounds great. I always thought it would be cool  to bring people instant relief.  I just\u2013 I really have so much respect for what you do.  Thank you.  Are you enjoying your shrimp tacos?  They\u2019re really good.  This is so nice.  More than dinner, it\u2019s nice to get  such positive feedback, you know?  It\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re really making a difference  \u2019cause sometimes, I question that.  Why would you ever question that?  Well, the clientele here is mostly rich white people,  and to be honest, I struggle with that.  Oh. I do think that there\u2019s a purpose in helping even rich people, you know?  Helping them to find healing,  making them feel more present, more aware.  -Yeah.  Because rich people,  they\u2019re the ones that, you know\u2026  are fucking up the whole world.  Yeah. I mean,  I know a lot of rich, white, fucked up people.  They could really use you.  Have\u2026  Have you ever thought about  starting, like, your own business?  Come on.  No, because I would be down for funding something like that.   -That\u2019s\u2013 I could be your publicist. Hey.  Thank you again for dinner last night.  Really, I had a great time. And it was cool,  you know, getting to know you more.  Yeah. You know, tonight\u2019s the night  -I put my mother into the sea.  Oh, wow. The boat leaves at 5:00.  I\u2019d really appreciate if you could be there.  I\u2019m here until 7:00.  Oh, geez. Well, uh\u2026  You know what? I\u2019ll take care of it.  I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sure one of the girls will be able to cover for me.  This is important. I wanna be there for you.  Oh, thank you. Thank you.  -Yeah.  And just so you know,  I\u2019m probably gonna be a little drunk,  so don\u2019t judge me, all right?  -No. No, I\u2019d never.  Okay.  -Boat leaves at 5:00.  Five o\u2019clock.  -All right.  I\u2019ll see you.  All right. I\u2019ll hold that for you. Oh my gosh.  How nice to be in love.  Mm. Mm. Yeah.  I wish I had a man here. I mean, you know, I\u2013 I\u2019m really happy you\u2019re here.  -You know what I mean.  I totally get it. All right.  My poor mother\u2026  she died in June.  And she loved the ocean. Just loved it.  My poor mother, she had a beautiful house in Carmel.  And she tried very, very hard to be a really good mother,  even though she didn\u2019t have any maternal instincts or skills.  She, uh, she was always in search of male affection.  And, uh, she was\u2026  a nymphomaniac.  I\u2019d walk in her room and I\u2019d find  all sorts of strange men in her bed.  She had borderline personality disorder.  She took her money  and she manipulated people with it.  And she was cruel. And she was very, very cruel.  She was so, so cruel and\u2026  I\u2013 I just\u2013 oh, mother, mother, mother, mother.  My mother\u2026  told me I would never be a ballerina,  and that was when I was skinny.  My poor mother, she\u2026  She just couldn\u2019t handle her jealousy.  She had to take me down.  And what\u2019s weird is I miss my mother  even though she was a big jerk!  I just\u2013 I need your help, everybody.  I\u2013 I\u2019ve been trying for many days now  to open this box.  My poor mother\u2019s in here.  I need someone to help me. I can\u2019t\u2013 I can\u2019t do this. You know, this is\u2013 I just realized it\u2019s too early for me. It\u2019s okay. Oh, I want my mother, mother, mother. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s totally okay. No, it\u2019s not okay! Okay, one second, let me just\u2026  What?  There you go.  -On the count of three.  Okay.  One, two, three. There you go.  -Good.  You\u2019re a beautiful woman.  Oh, thank you, Tanya.  Is it\u2013 Okay! You got it.  Let\u2019s just get the bottom half to join you.  There you go. Okay. All right.  -My head.  Oh.  -My head.  Let\u2019s\u2013  -Oh yeah.  -That\u2019s\u2026  Oh\u2013 oh, oh! There you go. All right.  Yeah.  -Okay.  Thank you.  Good night to her, and good night to you.  Everything\u2019s gonna be okay.  Mm-hmm?  Mm-hmm! You got it. Thank you.  Tanya, hi.  Oh.  I thought you might enjoy some peppermint tea before your wrap.  Oh, thank you.  Of course. Good to see you.  Yeah. Helps with\u2026 circulation.  Yeah. I just love peppermint tea.  It\u2019s good.  I just really wanna thank you for yesterday. And being there for me, getting me to my room. I mean, I was a mess.  You were fine.  It would\u2019ve been a hell of a lot worse if you hadn\u2019t been there. You have, like, a really beautiful, kind, and calming presence. Seriously, Belinda. I\u2019m not kidding. You\u2013 you should have your own wellness center. You should. Because you really know what you\u2019re doing.  That\u2019s really very sweet. Thank you.  You just can\u2019t be behind the desk at some hotel spa. You need to be in business for yourself.  I know.  Yeah, and hey, I\u2019m someone who can make that happen. You should really think about it. It\u2019s something I could use. You know, I could have a lot of fun too, and I could, you know, even give you a couple ideas. You know, the whole vision could be yours.  I\u2019m flattered. And I\u2019m very much interested.  Hey, one sec. Yeah, um\u2013 I, uh\u2013 I gotta have, um\u2026 You drink the peppermint tea for now, and, um, I wanna talk about this more, but I\u2019ll be way more clear after my oxygen facial. Okay. All right.  Let\u2019s get into business! Okay. This is the spa.  Hey, it\u2019s me.  Hey, Tanya.  Uh, listen, um\u2026 Is it okay if we push off our dinner till tomorrow? I\u2013 I got asked out, believe it or not. There\u2019s a deep-sea fisherman staying next door. And he\u2019s with a group from Black Lives Matter.  Yeah? Sure, no problem. I think a date will be good for you.  Oh, yeah, well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not\u2013 yeah, I\u2019m not sure, but yeah. I\u2019m so sorry to put off our dinner.  That\u2019s okay. You know, I got so excited about our conversation, I decided to write up a business proposal. I\u2019m working on it now. Have fun tonight.  Oh. All right. Well, hey. Thank you.  Yeah. Yeah.  All right.  Bye.  The date.  Was it not good?  Uh\u2026 No, it was good, you know?  He worked for the, uh, Bureau of Land Management.  Oh.  Not Black Lives Matter.  Shoot.  He stayed over. Yeah?  Yeah. And then he left.  Yeah. And he\u2013 yeah, he seem\u2013 he seemed like a nice guy.  So what\u2019s the problem?  I just know I\u2019m gonna get hurt.  I\u2013   I think you might be getting ahead of yourself a little, you know?  Maybe he likes you.  Yeah. He likes the first layer.  Maybe. I don\u2019t know. You know, he\u2013  But what about the second layer and the third layer?  And then every step along the way, you know, I have to worry about, you know, is he gonna like the next layer, you know?  And then I get all afraid, like, you know, how much do I wanna show him? You know, is he gonna be repulsed?  Or is he gonna be alarmed?  And at the core of the onion, Belinda\u2026 is just a straight-up alcoholic lunatic.  That\u2013 that\u2019s not true.  No, it is. It is. And I just wanna show my hand.  I don\u2019t wanna play poker anymore. I just wanna skip all the layers, and just go straight to the crazy, and just like, you know, let the chips fall where they may. And, you know, just show him, just show him the core of the onion.  I think you\u2026 you just have to trust your instincts, you know?  This is exactly the kind of deep work I think we can get into at the center.  I mean, I think there\u2019s just so many women that feel the same as you.  You know, I talk about some of that in the, um, in the proposal. And there\u2019s\u2026  probably too many ideas.  But, um, dream big, right?  We, of course, can always, um, pull back.  And there\u2019s no rush in, um, reading it, um, right now.  You\u2013 We can talk about it at dinner.  Okay, well\u2026  Well, I will look at it.  I, um, actually have to get back to the spa, so, um, I\u2019ll see you tonight?   Okay. Get some rest. So, you really didn\u2019t hear from him, huh?  Yeah. I\u2019d rather not talk about it.  Sorry. So, did you, um, get a chance to look at the proposal?  I\u2019ve been distracted.  That is totally understandable. Um\u2026  Did you send it on to your business manager?  I\u2019m going to.  Really sorry. I\u2019m just super curious, you know, and eager to hear what you guys think.  But we can talk about it another time. You know, what would be really exciting for me would be to make it a holistic experience.  Spiritual therapies and body treatments.  And I would love, love, love, love, love to make it so women from all economic backgrounds could benefit, you know? Not just rich women.  Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with\u2026  Excuse me.  \u2026um, rich women.  I just\u2013 You know what I mean.  Oh, my God.  Greg is at the Kahuna Bar. And he says he\u2019s waiting for me.  Oh, wow. I really\u2013  Oh\u2026  I hate to do this to you. No, and I\u2013 I really do.  I really wanna hear more.  It\u2019s just, I\u2013 I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s gonna be in town.  Yeah.  Just\u2026  That isn\u2019t\u2013 It\u2019s not gonna stay.  Okay.  Um\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just charge all this stuff to my room?  You can\u2013 you can even have more if you want.  I\u2019ll let you know what happens. Okay?  Yeah. Please do.  Good luck. Thank God you\u2019re here.  You know it.  Hey.  Hey.  Hi. Listen, I\u2019m\u2013  Oh, how did it go with your guy?  Good, good, yeah.  Yeah? Really?  Yeah. Actually, we\u2019re gonna go to Honolulu tomorrow.  Yeah, spend the weekend together.  That is so nice. Make sure to do some shopping.  I know.  And then maybe Aspen, you know, for a couple months, you know, see how that goes.  What? Making big moves?  Good for you, Tanya.  Anyway, we\u2019re gonna be leaving early, and I\u2013 I really just wanted to make sure that I didn\u2019t miss you.  Belinda, you\u2019re an amazing person. You are.  I mean, you\u2019ve helped me so much.  I was a mess.  I showed up here, and\u2013 and somehow, you were able to just jumpstart my life again.  And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever gonna be functional.   But I do think that now, I\u2019ll be able to break some old patterns.  Definitely.  Anyway, about the business\u2026 I really need to think about it.  I mean, you\u2019re so talented and I so wanna do this for you, but I\u2019m realizing I\u2019m getting back into this pattern again where I latch on to somebody and then I use my money to control them and see, right now, the last thing I need in my life is another transactional relationship.  You know, it\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s not healthy for me, you know?  Anyway, I really, I want you to know how grateful I am and I want you to have this.  Here.  I\u2019m gonna call you.  Okay.

And she tried very, very hard to be a really good mother,  even though she didn\u2019t have any maternal instincts or skills.  She, uh, she was always in search of male affection.  And, uh, she was\u2026  a nymphomaniac.  I\u2019d walk in her room and I\u2019d find  all sorts of strange men in her bed.  She had borderline personality disorder.  She took her money  and she manipulated people with it.  And she was cruel. And she was very, very cruel.  She was so, so cruel and\u2026  I\u2013 I just\u2013 oh, mother, mother, mother, mother.  My mother\u2026  told me I would never be a ballerina,  and that was when I was skinny.  My poor mother, she\u2026  She just couldn\u2019t handle her jealousy.  She had to take me down.

She\u2019s white as a sheet.  Don\u2019t worry. I have my own room. And I\u2019m here just one night, maybe two nights. I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m totally crazy. I know.   I was just so tense from the wedding and all the weeks leading up to it. I know you were too. And then Cathy Clement\u2013 I swear this was Cathy Clement\u2019s idea. She said, \u201cWe should do a spa week at the Mauna Kea.\u201d And of course that sounded amazing. And then I talked to you on the phone, honey, and you sounded so upset. You had me worried. And I thought, you know, maybe I\u2019ll just pop over and see you guys for a second and give you a little love and then be on my way and go meet Cathy at the Mauna Kea. Please don\u2019t be mad at your mother-in-law.  Oh, my God. Of course not. I\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m really, really happy to see you.  Oh, good. That makes me so happy. This is a really nice view. It\u2019s a really nice room. But it\u2019s definitely not the room I booked.  Trust me, I know.  Why did they give you this room, I wonder?  Mother\u2026 Don\u2019t even start. It\u2019s\u2026  Hmm? It\u2019s a touchy subject, huh?  Yeah. Do you? And Rachel, you were such a beautiful bride, but also very pale. But now you have a little more color, and it looks great. Thanks. I think that\u2019s a great idea, Rachel. I love working with all my charities. It\u2019s a great way to give back. And the great thing about it is you can be involved as much or as little as you want. So it gives you flexibility. I mean, I was actually, um\u2026 I really wanna get a job. No. Why would you do that?   Honey, no. Why would you wanna do that? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Uh-uh. You don\u2019t need to do that.  Why\u2013  Right.  What do you mean? Why not?  Well, it\u2019s just limiting. You can do so much more by being on boards and hosting events\u2026 things like that. And the good part is, you don\u2019t have to answer to anybody.  But I\u2013 I really wanna get involved, and what I really\u2026 I wanna do something meaningful.  Oh, but those jobs are so awful, honey. They make no money.  Yeah, but I don\u2019t need to make a lot of money.  But what\u2019s even the point? Those jobs are just asking wealthy people for their money. Your job would literally be to ask yourself for money. It\u2019s all about money. It\u2019s all about the money.   The money, money, money.  Money, money, money.  Money, money, money, money, money. And if you have money, then that\u2019s what you bring to the table. You don\u2019t need to work.   You throw parties. And that\u2019s work. That\u2019s a lot of work. Trust me. Your wedding took years off my life. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved it. I loved every minute of it. And I cannot remember a thing.   I don\u2019t remember anything. I\u2019m not kidding. I don\u2019t remember anything. It\u2019s a blur. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the most romantic hotel in Hawaii, do you? It\u2019s perfectly fine, but are you finding it very romantic? It\u2019s nice. Odd. I\u2019m not a fan of this AstroTurf. Didn\u2019t see the plunge. It\u2019s not as big as I though it would be.  You\u2019re a good sport to let your mother-in-law crash your honeymoon.  No, it\u2019s fine.  Well, if it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow morning first thing.  It\u2019s honestly not a problem, really.  It\u2019s ni\u2013 it\u2019s nice.  Well, I know you got enough of me in the whole lead-up to the wedding.  But it was a big success.  Everyone said what a beautiful bride you were.  Everyone was talking about it.  Thank you.  You were so, so pretty. It is undeniable.  Thanks.  Yeah. Shane\u2019s always been a catch. He\u2019s had so many girls just throw themselves at him over the years, but he chose you.  And he seems happy. You make him very happy.  He makes me happy.  That\u2019s good.  It is.  He says, though, you haven\u2019t been very happy on the trip.  He said that?  He did. He just said you\u2019re having a little bit of an identity crisis.  It\u2019s not a big deal. And of course, it makes sense.  You know, when I married Don, I had my own money, my family money, and that gave me a, you know, a little more power in the relationship.  No marriage is perfectly symmetrical, you know?  One person might have more money, or is better looking, the other could have the bigger career, or maybe one has more friends or cachet. Do you know what I\u2019m saying?  Not really.  I\u2019m just saying you shouldn\u2019t feel insecure.  A lot of great girls came and went, but you won.  And there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re here and all those other girls are out of the picture, you know?  So I just think you should feel great.  Yeah, but what is the reason?  Like, why am I here? What do you mean?  Well, you\u2019re very magnetic, and you\u2019re so beautiful.  You\u2019re making me sound like a trophy wife.  Well, what\u2019s so wrong with that?  A trophy shines. It\u2019s a source of pride.  A trophy\u2019s made of gold. You know, it\u2019s not the worst.  Yeah, but that\u2019s not what I wanna be.  The most important thing is, Rachel, you make him happy.  That\u2019s your secret power. So just keep making him happy.  I know you will. Rachel, do you want something to drink? Mm-mm.  Goodbye. Oh, I\u2019m leaving super early, so you won\u2019t see me, but I love you guys.  I\u2019m so happy I got to see you.  You\u2019re such a gorgeous couple, you have so much going for you, so be happy, okay?  Just be happy. Be happy, Rachel. Okay? I love you, guys. And I\u2019ll tell Cathy you say hi! And enjoy Tahiti!

Thanks.  And I just hope that you, like, think of me\u2026  and\u2026 remember this time\u2026 in a positive way.  Okay.  I love you.  I love you, too. They were partying all night and making weird lesbian noises. What? Love ya, bud. Ooh.Quinn, come on.Let\u2019s cut down on the screen time, okay?Come on. Look around.Isn\u2019t this place gorgeous, huh?Yeah?How lucky are we, huh?You know, when I was your age,my dad died.One of the great sadnesses of my life is thatyou two never got the chance to know each other.Dad, can I, um, save my game so I don\u2019t lose my score?Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.He was like a real alpha, you know?He was tough.He was tough on me.I worshipped him, you know?He was a good man.You know, when I thought I had cancer,-I told myself\u2013You mean yesterday?Yeah.Life\u2019s too short.You gotta make the most out of every moment.You know, we\u2019ve got to make the most out of every moment.Yeah, but with each other.So I signed us up to get certified in scuba.-No.Yeah, come on.-It\u2019s like eight hours in the pool.Eight hours?Yeah, but then we get to go out in the ocean!-Dad, that\u2019s gonna suck so hard.No, come on.Look, I wanna do this with you, pal.Like, my dad was like this sportsmanand we did all this active stuff together.I never passed that on to you, okay?So let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s mix it up, let\u2019s bro out. Come on.Okay, fine.-What?Fine.-Yes?Fine.You make me so happy. Hey, Dad.  What?  You\u2019re not eating anything.  I\u2019m not hungry.  That\u2019s your second Bloody Mary.  So? We have scuba after this.  I\u2019ll be fine. Dad.  What?  If you don\u2019t feel like doing this now, it\u2019s fine.  Nah. It\u2019s just like\u2026  What is real? Like, what\u2026 You know? What\u2019s real?  Are you gay?  No.  Hey. \u2018Cause if you are, it\u2019s okay.  -Just, like, be real.  I am being real.  What\u2019s real is\u2026  like, gay, straight, whatever, we\u2019re just monkeys,  we\u2019re just fucking monkeys.  -Yeah?  Yeah. Yeah, we\u2019re just animals.  I mean, you know, we wanna be, like\u2026  superheroes and respectable fathers  and pillars in our communities, whatever,  but\u2013 but in fact, we\u2019re just monkeys\u2026  living in our own little monkey pods,  driven by base instincts to create these hierarchies  and hump each other.  I thought I knew my father, you know?  I only knew the part that he wanted me to see.  He hid the monkey, and that screwed me up, Quinn.  -You think that\u2019s what did it?  Yeah, definitely.  Hey, I thought\u2013  My whole life, I thought I was the flawed child of an icon.  Like, I put him on this, like, enormous pedestal.  Meanwhile, like, he\u2019s off in some bathhouse on the DL,  getting manhandled by some\u2026  like, random dudes.  Wow.  Oh, I wish I had known.  I\u2019m sorry.  Yeah.  But I get it. I mean, you know,  you don\u2019t want your kid thinking you\u2019re some sex-crazed lunatic. Do you wanna know me? May\u2013 maybe.  Do you?  I don\u2019t know.  Maybe it\u2019s better if I\u2019m just really real with you.  Maybe that\u2019s the healthier legacy.  I think it is. Yeah. Get me the Kahuna with guac. All right? I\u2019m gonna go to the bathroom. I\u2019ll be right back. Enjoying your time? What are you talking about? Nothing. Sex with your mom. Was it something I said? It\u2019s natural to want something new. I mean, when you\u2019re jerking to porn,  do you watch the same clip every time?  No. Never.  -I think I\u2019m gonna go. Yeah? Okay.  Um, can I borrow your phone?  Mine\u2019s gone, and I need to get online.  Uh\u2026 all right.  See you back in the room. Okay. I\u2019m gonna need somebody\u2019s phone today. I can\u2019t go another day without a phone. You had my phone all day yesterday. Okay, can I have it again? No. I need it. Okay, but you guys are gonna regret this. Hey, remember we got scuba, bud. Buddy, Quinn, yesterday\u2026 I think I said some things that I probably shouldn\u2019t have.  Like what?  Well\u2026 I don\u2019t really remember exactly what I said, so\u2026 You said having sex with mom was like eating a plate of live worms.  I said that? \u2026  Quinn, look, okay, that\u2019s not because of your mother. Your mother is beautiful. Like, I\u2019m lucky. I mean, the truth is\u2026 Do you wanna know the truth?  Okay.  I cheated on your\u2013 your mother once. Well, not once, but with one woman. You know, a few times. Um, a couple\u2013 it was a couple of times.  You did?  Yeah.  Does Mom know?  Yeah, she knows. Of course she knows. And dealing with it, dealing with her, getting her to forgive me, was\u2026 it was hell. It was the worst time in my life. We managed to keep you kids in the dark, but she almost left me. And, you know, there was a lot of drama. We had to do all this therapy. Yeah, I bought her a pair of bracelets for 75,000 dollars.  What?  Yeah. With my money. Not her money.   Man\u2026 in the moment\u2026 you\u2019re like this\u2026 You\u2019re a monkey. Like possessed. You\u2019d do anything to get your rocks off. And then, later, you regret it. And you do regret it.   There\u2019s the man, and there\u2019s the monkey. And somehow, you gotta be man enough to face down the monkey.  Dad\u2026 I think that guy was hitting on you. He was just, you know, being friendly. Hey. Hey! Drop it, pal. Where have you been?  I was on this, um\u2026 canoe.  Uh, these local guys, they\u2026 they were training.  They\u2019re\u2013 they\u2019re gonna paddle from the Big Island to Kauai. Yeah, well, you should have let us know. I don\u2019t have a phone.  Right.  Hey, you getting excited, bud?  About what?  Today we get outta the pool. We could actually scuba dive.  Oh, right.  And I asked, and they said it was okay if the whole family came out on the dive boat. Dad! You\u2019re not going?  So, how was, uh, scuba diving?  Uh\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Uh\u2026 I didn\u2019t do it.  I wanna wait for you.  You do?  The guy said we could go out tomorrow.  Wow.  It hurts to smile. How bad does it look? Yeah, Dad. You saved Mom. You\u2019re a total stud. I don\u2019t know about that. Where have you been, man? I was on the canoe. We went all around the island. It was cool. And in an hour, we\u2019re going scuba. I\u2019m pretty beat. Uh, my arms are like numb. Well, we still gotta scuba. It\u2019s the last day we can do it. Why?  \u2018Cause we go home tomorrow.  Oh.  I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m not going home.  Yeah, I think I wanna stay here.  The guys need a sixth for their crossing \u2019cause the guy that they\u2019ve been training with,  he keeps flaking \u2019cause he\u2019s a drunk.  And in the spring, we\u2019re all gonna do a Hokule\u2019a through all of Polynesia, which sounds amazing.  This is absurd. What about your life at home? What life at home? Wait. I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being serious. I\u2019m very serious. This is ridiculous. Look, staying here without us, not an option, no. Yeah, buddy! You\u2019re right, yeah, man. We are so lucky. Hey, Quinn, you\u2019re 16, you\u2019re a minor. You\u2019re still ours, and we want you home, okay?  I think\u2013 I think it\u2019s a good idea to get out the city more often.
